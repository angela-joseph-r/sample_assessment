# sample_assessment

From this link: https://www.visitindy.com/indianapolis-things-to-do-events?page=10 and google maps. I created three csv files about housing, restaurants, and events respectively. In housing, I look for the distance between each possible cowroking location and the housing by distance in miles by car or by bike. Given that the interns make not have access to a car, a bike might be more affordable. For the restaurants, I searched for all restaurants in Indianapolis and pick a couple of different cuisines to accomodate for differing tastes of the interns. For the events, I used the Indy events website and filtered my search by music, sports, and arts related events. For the events, I also took note of the distance between the event place and the coworking location. From the data it looks like the Industrious Mass Ave and Launch Indy consistly are near the restaurants, event locations, and housing.
